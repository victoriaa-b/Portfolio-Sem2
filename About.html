            Hi, I'm Victoria, an aspiring software developer from Conception Bay
            South, Newfoundland. Currently, I'm pursuing a Software Development
            program at Keyin College, having previously completed a bachelor's
            degree at university. This isn't my first post-secondary education;
            after graduation, I felt the need to dive deeper into my interests
            to find something I truly loved.
          </p>

            My journey into technology wasn't typical. Initially, I wanted to
            work with my best friend for the summer, so I applied for a job. I
            never expected that this opportunity would completely change my
            life. It opened my eyes to a new world, and suddenly, computer
            programming became one of my favorite subjects.

            In my personal life, I'm pretty laid back. I work part-time as a
            programming instructor while continuing my studies. When I'm not at
            work or in class, you'll find me in a cozy spot, reading with my
            pug, Deino, or planning my next trip. I love traveling to different
            parts of Canada and Europe, though I travel less often now because
            Deino isn't a fan of leaving the house.
